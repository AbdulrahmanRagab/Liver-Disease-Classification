# 🩺 Indian Liver Disease Prediction using ML

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting liver disease in patients using the **Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD)**. Multiple machine learning models were applied, including **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**, **K-Nearest Neighbors**, and a **Voting Classifier Ensemble**, to determine the best-performing classifier. The pipeline covers **data preprocessing**, **feature scaling**, **model training**, and **evaluation metrics** for robust classification analysis.

## ✅ Key Achievements

* ✔️ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handled missing values and transformed features to improve model accuracy using `StandardScaler`.
* ✔️ **Feature Engineering**: Selected appropriate features for model input after dropping irrelevant or redundant columns (e.g., `gender`).
* ✔️ **Model Training & Optimization**:

  * Logistic Regression achieved **68.1% accuracy**.
  * Decision Tree Classifier reached **65.9% accuracy** using `min_samples_leaf` optimization.
  * K-Nearest Neighbors (K=72) reached the highest accuracy of **69.3%**.
  * Combined all models using **VotingClassifier** (soft voting) for ensemble learning.
* ✔️ **Confusion Matrix Analysis**: Evaluated model performance using confusion matrices to interpret false positives/negatives.
* ✔️ **Modular ML Workflow**: Designed an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using `scikit-learn` for reproducibility and scalability.
